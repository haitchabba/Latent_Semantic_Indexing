At the time of its completion in 2012, the building was the tallest all-residential tower in the world, a title that is destined to change hands rapidly in the coming years given the number of tall residential towers due for completion.\n\nThe tower incorporates several strategies to manage the safety of its occupants. High-tech fire detection and suppression systems manage risks in the building, exceeding most jurisdictional requirements. To increase comfort levels, a tuned sloshing damper tank was integrated at the roof level to compensate for the lateral movement of the tower. Additionally, a wind-speed alarm was installed in each apartment on upper floors to warn residents of high winds prior to opening balcony doors. By combining world-class luxury and safety performance, Princess Tower set the standard for supertall residential structures."
